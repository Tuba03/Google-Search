# Google Search Clone – HTML & CSS Project

This project replicates the layout and functionality of Google's search interface using only **HTML and CSS**. It includes:

- ✅ A basic search page
- ✅ An image search page
- ✅ An advanced search form

All pages are fully functional and redirect to real Google search results using GET requests.

## 📄 Pages Overview

### 🔍 Main Search Page (`index.html`)
- Lets users enter a search query and submit via:
  - **Google Search** – redirects to Google results
  - **I'm Feeling Lucky** – redirects to the first result
- Includes navigation links to:
  - Image Search (`index2.html`)
  - Advanced Search (`index3.html`)

### 🖼️ Image Search Page (`index2.html`)

- Styled similarly to the main page

### 🧠 Advanced Search Page (`index3.html`)
- Includes four fields:
  - All these words
  - This exact word or phrase
  - Any of these words
  - None of these words
- Mimics Google's official Advanced Search
- Submits to `https://www.google.com/search` with advanced parameters (`as_q`, `as_epq`, etc.)
